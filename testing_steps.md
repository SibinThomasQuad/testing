When an application is about to go live or undergo testing for quality assurance (QA), there are several important testing activities and considerations that should be addressed. Here is a list of common testing activities and tasks to perform before and during the release of an application:

1. **Unit Testing:**
   - Test individual units or components of the application to ensure their correctness.

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test the interactions between different modules or components to ensure that they work together seamlessly.

3. **Functional Testing:**
   - Verify that the application functions as intended and meets all specified requirements.
   
4. **Regression Testing:**
   - Re-run previous test cases to ensure that new changes or features haven't introduced new defects.

5. **User Interface (UI) Testing:**
   - Ensure that the user interface is user-friendly, consistent, and follows design guidelines.

6. **Compatibility Testing:**
   - Check how the application performs on different browsers, devices, and operating systems.

7. **Performance Testing:**
   - Assess the application's speed, responsiveness, and scalability under different loads.

8. **Load Testing:**
   - Test the application's ability to handle a large number of concurrent users or requests.

9. **Security Testing:**
   - Identify and fix vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other security threats.

10. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    - Involve end-users to ensure the application meets their needs and expectations.

11. **Compatibility Testing:**
    - Ensure that the application works correctly on various devices, screen sizes, and browsers.

12. **Data Migration Testing:**
    - If there is data migration involved, validate that data is transferred correctly and is consistent with the original data.

13. **API Testing:**
    - Verify that APIs work as expected and provide the necessary data or functionality.

14. **Database Testing:**
    - Check database integrity, data accuracy, and data retrieval efficiency.

15. **Scalability and Performance Testing:**
    - Assess how the application performs under increasing loads and identify performance bottlenecks.

16. **Usability Testing:**
    - Evaluate the application's overall user experience to ensure it is intuitive and user-friendly.

17. **Accessibility Testing:**
    - Ensure the application is accessible to people with disabilities, adhering to WCAG standards.

18. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
    - Verify that the application functions correctly on various web browsers.

19. **Cross-Platform Testing:**
    - Confirm the application works well on different operating systems and platforms.

20. **Documentation Review:**
    - Review and update user manuals, help guides, and any other documentation.

21. **Backup and Recovery Testing:**
    - Test data backup and recovery processes in case of data loss or system failure.

22. **Security and Compliance Audits:**
    - Ensure the application complies with industry regulations and security best practices.

23. **Localization and Internationalization Testing:**
    - Test for multiple languages and cultural adaptations if applicable.

24. **Stress Testing:**
    - Determine how the application behaves under extreme loads and high traffic conditions.

25. **Deployment and Rollback Testing:**
    - Test the deployment process to ensure smooth releases and establish a rollback plan in case of issues.

26. **User Training and Documentation:**
    - Ensure that end-users are adequately trained and provided with necessary documentation.

27. **Performance Monitoring Setup:**
    - Implement monitoring tools to track the application's performance and availability in the live environment.

28. **User Support and Issue Tracking:**
    - Set up processes for user support and issue tracking, including bug reporting and resolution.

29. **Post-Release Review:**
    - Conduct a post-release review to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

30. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - Establish mechanisms for ongoing testing and continuous improvement based on user feedback and changing requirements.

Testing is a crucial part of the software development life cycle, and thorough testing helps ensure the quality and reliability of the application before it goes live. The specific tests and activities may vary depending on the nature of the application and the organization's standards and requirements.
